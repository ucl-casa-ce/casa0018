<h1>Lab 6</h1>

Use Plants and Mugs data set and Edge Impulse to perform image classification using:
 a) Regular CNN
 b) Transfer Learning
 
Which performs better?

The dataset can be found here:
https://github.com/ucl-casa-ce/casa0018/tree/main/Week6/data

You can upload data from all the folders since Edge Impulse will automatically perform the training/validation/testing split

You don’t need to deploy the trained model to the Arduino, but you could try running it on your mobile phone
